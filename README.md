# üèÄ NBA Game Predictor App
Welcome to the NBA Game Predictor! This single-page web application provides a clean and modern interface for viewing basketball game predictions. Built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, it offers a great user experience right in your browser.

## ‚ú® Features
- Sleek & Responsive UI: The app looks great on any device, from desktop to mobile.
- Game Predictions: Get a clear overview of today's matchups with predicted winners and win probabilities.
- Confidence Scores: Each prediction includes a confidence score, giving you a better idea of the model's certainty.
- Simulated Backend: The app includes mock data to simulate a working backend, so you can see the interface in action immediately.

## üöÄ How to Run the App
- This application is designed to be as simple as possible to get up and running. You don't need to install any frameworks or a complex build environment.
- Save the Code: Copy the full HTML code provided and save it as a file named index.html.
- Open in Browser: Double-click the index.html file, and it will open directly in your web browser.
- It's that easy! The code uses CDNs to import all the necessary libraries (React, ReactDOM, Babel, and Tailwind CSS), so everything is self-contained.

## üíª Connecting to a Real Backend
- The current version of the app uses static mock data for demonstration. To make it a live, functional application, you will need to:
- Create an API: Use a Python web framework like Flask or FastAPI to create an API endpoint from your nba_game_prediction.py script. This API should handle requests and return the prediction data as JSON.
- Update the Code: Modify the fetchPredictions function in the index.html file to make a fetch call to your new API endpoint.
